        <h4 class="blue-heading">Why should you learn?</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>Adobe Photoshop is the most popular program for creating and modifying images for the web.</li>
            <li>This is true not only because Photoshop is available on a wide array of platforms ranging from Mac to Windows to UNIX, but because after four generations of development, Adobe Photoshop has the most intuitive user interface, the most complete set of tools, and the largest number of reference books around.</li>
            <li>In fact, as Deke McClelland says in Photoshop 3 Bible, "Some estimates say that Photoshop sales exceed those of all of its competitors combined."</li>
