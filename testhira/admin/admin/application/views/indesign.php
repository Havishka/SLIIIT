        <p>InDesign, Adobe's replacement for PageMaker, is an industry-standard desktop publishing program. Its uses range from print production to digital publishing. Primarily used for layout rather than as a content-creation tool, InDesign has is used to combine text, images, vectors and other prepared content into a finished product for publishing. The newest versions of InDesign allow for a variety of digital publication methods ranging from interactive PDFs to full-fledged iPad applications. </p>

        <h4 class="blue-heading">Why should you learn?</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>In InDesign, the graphics are placed and laid out in a form that REAL professional designers know works in an effective way to get a particular message across. </li>
            <li>It has very powerful text tools and style sheets to make a lot of typesetting operations a LOT easier. Multipage documents, such as books and magazines, as well as newspapers and catalogues can be quickly laid out, as this application was, specifically designed to do. </li>
            <li>While InDesign can make a few, simple vector grapics, these functions are severely limited. And there is no way InDesign can make color corrections like Photoshop can do. </li>
            <li>This is the standard in most of the Magazine printing industry. You are doing yourself a favor by learning InDesign.</li>
